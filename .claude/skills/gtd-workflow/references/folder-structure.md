# GTD + PARA Folder Structure Reference

This document defines the expected folder structure for the GTD + Second Brain workflow system.

## Overview

The system uses the **PARA method** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) for organization combined with GTD principles for workflow management.

**Note:** This is a generic template. The `/setup` command will customize folder names based on your specific needs.

## Folder Hierarchy

## Folder Purposes

### 00-Inbox/
**Purpose:** Temporary storage for all captured content before processing

**Status:** Items here should have `status: inbox`

**Processing:** Use `/process-inbox` command to clear to zero (3x per week minimum)

**Subfolders:**
- `Daily/` - Daily captures from `/capture` command
- `Fleeting-Notes/` - Temporary thought captures

### 01-Projects/
**Purpose:** Time-bound goals with clear end states (3-12 months typically)

**GTD Mapping:** Both GTD projects (multi-step outcomes) and PARA projects live here

**Status Values:** `inbox`, `next`, `active`, `waiting`, `someday`, `done`, `archived`

**Structure:**
```
01-Projects/
  └── {Area-Name}/               # Work, Personal, Side-Business, etc.
      └── {Project-Name}/
          ├── _Project.md        # Main project file
          ├── Tasks/             # Optional: Individual task notes
          ├── Resources/         # Project-specific knowledge
          └── Archive/           # Completed project items
```

**Note:** Small projects (2-3 steps) can be a single file. Large projects (10+ steps) should have their own folder.

**Examples:**
- `01-Projects/Work/Website-Redesign/`
- `01-Projects/Personal/Home-Renovation/`
- `01-Projects/Side-Business/Product-Launch/`

### 02-Areas/
**Purpose:** Ongoing responsibilities with no clear end date

**GTD Mapping:** Areas of Focus and Responsibility

**Status Values:** Usually `active` (areas don't complete, they maintain)

**Examples:**
- Career development
- Personal development
- Health and fitness
- Relationships and family
- Financial management
- Home and living space

**Note:** Areas contain recurring tasks and standards to maintain, not projects. Projects that support an area should live in `01-Projects/` and reference the area.

### 03-Resources/
**Purpose:** Reference material that is not actionable

**GTD Mapping:** Reference filing system

**Status:** Not applicable (reference material doesn't have status)

**Types:**
- Knowledge base articles
- Permanent notes (Zettelkasten)
- Literature notes
- Research materials
- How-to guides
- SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

**Note:** If something in Resources becomes actionable, create a project in `01-Projects/` and link back to the resource.

### 04-Archives/
**Purpose:** Completed projects and inactive areas

**GTD Mapping:** Archive storage

**When to Archive:**
- Projects with `status: done` after weekly review
- Inactive areas
- Old reference material no longer relevant

**Note:** Don't delete unless truly not needed. Archives preserve history and context.

### 05-Meta/
**Purpose:** System documentation, templates, and operational files

**Contents:**
- `Templates/` - Note templates
- `Reviews/` - Weekly review summaries
- `MOCs/` - Maps of Content (navigation hubs)

**Note:** This folder supports the system itself, not your work content.

## Folder References in Commands

### /capture
Quick captures go to:
- `ObsidianVault/00-Inbox/Daily/{{date}}.md`

Brain dumps archive to:
- `ObsidianVault/03-Resources/Reference-Notes/brain-dumps/`

### /process-inbox
Scans:
- `ObsidianVault/00-Inbox/Daily/`
- `ObsidianVault/00-Inbox/Fleeting-Notes/`

Files to:
- `ObsidianVault/01-Projects/{Area}/` (for projects)
- `ObsidianVault/02-Areas/{Area}/` (for ongoing responsibilities)
- `ObsidianVault/03-Resources/{Topic}/` (for reference)

### /daily-plan
Reads:
- `ObsidianVault/01-Projects/` (all files with `status: active`)
- `ObsidianVault/02-Areas/` (active areas with tasks)
- `ObsidianVault/_Context.md`
- `ObsidianVault/Permanent Notes/Assisting-User-Context.md`

Updates:
- `ObsidianVault/_Context.md`

### /daily-closeout

- `ObsidianVault/Daily Plans/{{today}}.md`

Updates:
- `ObsidianVault/Daily Plans/{{today}}.md` (marks completions)

Creates:
- `ObsidianVault/Daily Plans/{{tomorrow}}.md` (draft plan)

## Flexibility Notes

**Your vault may differ:**
- Folder names may vary based on `/setup` customization
- Depth may vary (some users prefer flatter, some deeper)
- Area and project names will be customized to your needs

**The skill adapts:**
- Commands will work with whatever folder structure exists
- If folders don't exist, commands will suggest creating them
- The PARA principle is the important part, not exact naming

**Minimum Required:**
- `ObsidianVault/01-Projects/` (for actionable projects)
- `ObsidianVault/00-Inbox/` (for captures)
- `ObsidianVault/Daily Plans/` (for daily planning)

Everything else can evolve over time.

**Customization:**
During `/setup`, you'll define your specific areas and projects. The examples shown here (Work, Personal, Career-Development, etc.) are placeholders that will be replaced with your actual areas of focus.

**Processing guidance:**
When ready, this should become either:
1. **Permanent Note** - If it's an insight you want to develop
2. **Reference Note** - If it's just information from a source
3. **Added to Project** - If it's actually an action item
4. **Deleted** - If no longer relevant

**How to tell:**
- Your insight → Permanent Note
- Their information → Reference Note
- Actionable → Add to project

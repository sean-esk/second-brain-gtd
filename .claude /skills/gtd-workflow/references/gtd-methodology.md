# Getting Things Done (GTD) Methodology Reference

> Complete overview of David Allen's GTD system - the foundational methodology this skill implements

---

## What is GTD?

**Getting Things Done (GTD)** is a personal productivity system developed by David Allen, first published in 2001 (revised 2015).

**Core Principle:**
> "There is an inverse relationship between the things occupying your mind and the things you actually accomplish."

**The GTD Promise:**
By externalizing your thoughts and commitments into a **trusted system**, you free your mental capacity to focus on execution rather than remembering what needs to be done.

---

## Core Philosophy

### Open Loops

**Definition:** Incomplete tasks, unresolved issues, and lingering thoughts that continuously circulate in your mind, creating stress and distraction.

**The Problem:**
- Your brain is designed for having ideas, not holding them
- Trying to remember everything creates cognitive burden
- Stress comes from unclear commitments and next actions
- Context switching between remembering and doing kills productivity

**The Solution:**
- **Capture everything** externally in a trusted system
- **Define desired outcomes** clearly for each commitment
- **Identify next physical actions** for every project
- **Review regularly** to maintain trust in the system

**Result:** You can work on present tasks without the cognitive burden of remembering everything else you're responsible for.

## The Five-Stage Workflow

GTD processes everything flowing into your life through five stages:

### 1. CAPTURE

**Purpose:** Get everything out of your head into a trusted external system.

**How it works:**
- Create one or more inboxes (physical, digital, or both)
- Collect EVERYTHING that has your attention:
  - Ideas
  - Tasks
  - Phone calls to make
  - Shopping lists
  - Projects
  - Any thought requiring action or attention

**Key Principles:**
- **Don't organize during capture** - Just write it down
- **No judgment** - Capture it all, decide later
- **Multiple inboxes OK** - But process all of them regularly
- **Mind dump** - When starting GTD, externalize all existing open loops

**Why it matters:** Until it's captured in a trusted system, your mind keeps bringing it up.

---

### 2. CLARIFY

**Purpose:** Process each captured item to determine its meaning and what action, if any, it requires.

**The Clarifying Questions:**

For each item in your inbox, ask:

**Q1: What is it?**
- Understand what you captured
- One-sentence summary

**Q2: Is it actionable?**
- Can you DO something about this?
- **If NO →** Go to non-actionable options (trash, reference, someday/maybe)
- **If YES →** Continue to Q3

**Q3: What's the desired outcome?**
- What does "done" look like?
- **Single action needed?** → It's a TASK
- **Multiple actions needed?** → It's a PROJECT

**Q4: What's the next physical action?**
- Must be **concrete** and **visible**
- Must be something you can actually DO
- Examples:
  - ✅ "Call John at 555-1234 to discuss proposal"
  - ✅ "Draft executive summary for Q2 presentation"
  - ❌ "Think about proposal" (not physical)
  - ❌ "John" (not an action)

**Q5: Where does it belong?**
- Is this your action or someone else's?
- What's the context required? (computer, phone, office, etc.)
- What's the priority?

**Critical Rule:** Process one item at a time. Don't put clarified items back in the inbox.

---

### 3. ORGANIZE

**Purpose:** Put each clarified item into its appropriate location.

**The Eight End Points:**

Items distribute to one of eight places:

1. **Trash** - Not actionable, not needed → Delete it
2. **Someday/Maybe List** - Not now, but might do later → Review periodically
3. **Reference Filing** - Not actionable, but keep for reference → File it
4. **Project List** - Multi-step outcome → Add to projects, define next action
5. **Do Immediately** - Takes < 2 minutes → Just do it now (Two-Minute Rule)
6. **Delegate** - Someone else's action → Hand off and track in waiting-for list
7. **Next Action Lists** - Organized by context → Add to appropriate list
8. **Calendar** - Date/time specific → Schedule it

**Organization Categories:**

| Category | What Goes Here | Key Rule |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Projects** | Any outcome requiring >1 action step | Must have defined next action |
| **Next Actions** | Single physical actions by context | Must be doable right now (given context) |
| **Waiting For** | Items delegated or blocked by others | Track who/what/when |
| **Someday/Maybe** | Ideas to consider later | Review during reflection |
| **Calendar** | Date-specific commitments only | Don't use as to-do list |
| **Reference** | Non-actionable information | Easy to find when needed |

**The Two-Minute Rule:**
If an action takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately when you encounter it during processing. It takes longer to capture, defer, and re-review than to just do it.

**Critical Guideline:** Empty your inboxes daily or at least weekly. Never put clarified items back into the inbox.

---

### 4. REFLECT (Review)

**Purpose:** Regularly review your system to ensure it remains current and trusted.

**What to Review:**
- Process all inboxes to zero
- Review next actions for all projects
- Update project lists and statuses
- Check waiting-for items
- Review calendar (past week and upcoming)
- Review someday/maybe list

**Frequency:**

**Daily (Quick Scan):**
- Check calendar for commitments
- Review next action lists
- Quick scan of waiting-for items
- Update as you complete things

**Weekly (Full Review):**
- **Get Clear:** Process all inboxes to zero, collect loose ends
- **Get Current:** Review all project lists, ensure next actions are defined
- **Get Creative:** Review someday/maybe, capture new ideas
- **Get Perspective:** Check calendar, assess priorities

**Why Weekly Review is Non-Negotiable:**
- Maintains trust in the system
- Prevents items from falling through cracks
- Provides perspective on all commitments
- Keeps system current with changing realities

---

### 5. ENGAGE (Execute)

**Purpose:** Do the work with confidence that you're working on the right things.

**How to Choose What to Work On:**

Use the **Four Criteria Model** to select from available next actions:

1. **Context** - What can you do given your location and tools?
   - At computer? → Check computer list
   - On phone? → Check calls list
   - At office? → Check office list

2. **Time Available** - How long do you have?
   - 5 minutes until meeting? → Quick tasks only
   - 2-hour focus block? → Deep work items

3. **Energy Available** - What's your mental/physical state?
   - High energy? → Creative or complex work
   - Low energy? → Administrative or routine tasks

4. **Priority** - Among available options, what's most important?
   - Aligned with current goals?
   - Due dates approaching?
   - High impact work?

**The Decision Process:**

```
Context filters available actions
    ↓
Time available narrows the list
    ↓
Energy level refines further
    ↓
Priority determines final selection
```

**GTD Insight:** Most productivity systems start with priority. GTD recognizes you can't do high-priority work if you're not in the right context or don't have enough time/energy. Context comes first.

## Key GTD Concepts

### Projects vs. Tasks

**Task (Next Action):** A single physical, visible activity that can be completed in one step.
- Examples: "Email John", "Call dentist", "Draft outline"

**Project:** Any outcome that requires more than one action step.
- Examples: "Launch new website", "Plan vacation", "Organize garage"
- **Rule:** Every project must have at least one defined next action

**Common Mistake:** Calling something a task when it's actually a project.
- "Fix website" is a project (requires multiple steps)
- "Update homepage copy with new tagline" is a task (single action)

---

### Next Actions - The Heart of GTD

**Definition:** A physical, visible activity that progresses something toward completion.

**Good Next Actions:**
- ✅ Concrete and specific
- ✅ Clearly executable
- ✅ Physical (something you can see yourself doing)
- ✅ Contextual (defines where/with what tools)

**Examples:**

| Bad Next Action | Why? | Good Next Action |
|-----------------|------|------------------|
| "Follow up on proposal" | Too vague | "Call John at 555-1234 to discuss proposal next steps" |
| "Think about presentation" | Not physical | "Draft three main points for Q2 presentation" |
| "John" | Not an action | "Email John to schedule design review meeting" |
| "Website" | Not specific | "Research three WordPress themes for website redesign" |

**Allen's Test:** If you can't visualize yourself doing it, it's not a good next action.

---

### Contexts

**Definition:** Physical locations or tools required to complete actions.

**Purpose:** Filter your next actions by what's physically possible right now.

**Common Contexts:**
- @Computer - Any computer work
- @Office - At office desk
- @Home - Personal errands/tasks at home
- @Phone - Phone calls (can be made anywhere)
- @Errands - Out and about running errands
- @Anywhere - Can do in any location
- @Waiting - Blocked by someone else (waiting-for items)

**How to Use:**
- Tag each next action with its required context
- When you're in a context, review only those actions
- Dramatically reduces decision fatigue

**Example:**
You're at your desk with 30 minutes before a meeting. Filter by @Computer + 30min or less = your available options.

---

### Waiting-For List

**Purpose:** Track items you've delegated or that are blocked by external dependencies.

**What to Track:**
- Items delegated to others
- Responses you're waiting for
- Deliverables from vendors/partners
- Approvals or decisions from stakeholders

**Critical Info to Capture:**
- **What** you're waiting for
- **Who** is responsible
- **When** you delegated it or made the request
- **Follow-up date** (when you'll check in if no response)

**Example Entries:**
- "Waiting for John - Budget approval - Requested 10/15 - Follow up 10/22"
- "Waiting for Vendor - API documentation - Requested 10/18"

**Review Frequency:**
- Weekly minimum
- Daily scan for high-priority items
- Follow up on items >7 days old

---

### Someday/Maybe List

**Purpose:** Capture ideas and possibilities you're not ready to commit to now.

**What Goes Here:**
- Project ideas you might pursue later
- Skills you'd like to learn someday
- Places you'd like to visit
- Books to read "eventually"

**Why It's Important:**
- Clears your mind of "I should do this someday" guilt
- Preserves good ideas without committing now
- Reviewed during weekly reflection (might move some to active)

**Not a Graveyard:**
Review this list regularly. Items either:
- Move to active projects (now's the time!)
- Stay on someday/maybe (still not ready)
- Get deleted (no longer interesting)

---

## The Weekly Review

**Purpose:** Maintain the system's currency and your trust in it.

**The Classic Checklist:**

**Get Clear (Collect and Process):**
- [ ] Collect loose papers, business cards, receipts
- [ ] Process email inboxes to zero
- [ ] Process physical inbox to zero
- [ ] Process notes and voice memos
- [ ] Empty your head - brain dump any new items

**Get Current (Review and Update):**
- [ ] Review previous week's calendar for remaining actions
- [ ] Review upcoming calendar (next 2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Review next action lists (mark completed, add new)
- [ ] Review waiting-for list (follow up on stale items)
- [ ] Review all project lists
- [ ] Ensure every project has at least one next action defined

**Get Creative (Reflect and Plan):**
- [ ] Review someday/maybe list
- [ ] Be creative and courageous (capture new ideas)

**Get Perspective:**
- [ ] Identify top priorities for next week
- [ ] Archive completed projects
- [ ] Feel in control and ready

**Time Required:** 30-60 minutes
**Frequency:** Weekly (Friday afternoon is common)
**Non-Negotiable:** Skipping weekly reviews causes system decay

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Vague Next Actions
**Problem:** "Work on proposal" isn't actionable
**Solution:** Must be physical. "Draft executive summary section of proposal" is actionable

### Mistake 2: Projects Without Next Actions
**Problem:** Projects stall because no concrete next step
**Solution:** Every project MUST have a defined next action. Check during weekly review

### Mistake 3: Using Calendar as To-Do List
**Problem:** Calendar fills with tasks that aren't date-specific
**Solution:** Only date/time-specific commitments on calendar. Everything else on next action lists

### Mistake 4: Too Many Active Projects
**Problem:** Spreading attention thin, nothing gets done
**Solution:** Limit active projects (3-5 per area), move others to someday/maybe

### Mistake 5: Not Processing Inbox Regularly
**Problem:** Inbox becomes a black hole, system loses trust
**Solution:** Process to zero at least 3x per week. Daily is better

### Mistake 6: Skipping Weekly Review
**Problem:** System decays, trust erodes, stress returns
**Solution:** Make it non-negotiable. Schedule it. Protect the time

## GTD Horizons of Focus (Optional)

GTD also includes a framework for reviewing at different altitudes:

- **Runway:** Current next actions (day-to-day)
- **10,000 feet:** Current projects (1-2 weeks)
- **20,000 feet:** Areas of responsibility (what you maintain)
- **30,000 feet:** Goals (1-2 year objectives)
- **40,000 feet:** Vision (3-5 year direction)
- **50,000 feet:** Purpose and principles (life purpose)

**Use:** Different reviews happen at different frequencies. Daily = runway, Weekly = 10-20k feet, Quarterly = 30-40k feet, Annual = 50k feet.

---

## Principles, Not Prescriptions

**GTD is tool-agnostic:**
- Works with paper and pen
- Works with apps and software
- Works with any organizational system

**What matters:**
- Simplicity - Use tools simple enough to use when energy is low
- Consistency - Process regularly
- Trust - System must be reliable and current
- Completeness - Everything is captured, nothing in your head

**Allen's Advice:** "Use the simplest tool that will work." Don't over-engineer.

```
STUFF (inputs)
    ↓
CAPTURE (inbox)
    ↓
CLARIFY: Is it actionable?
    ├─ NO → Reference / Someday-Maybe / Trash
    └─ YES → What's the outcome?
            ├─ Single action → NEXT ACTION (by context)
            └─ Multiple actions → PROJECT
                                   ↓
                        Define desired outcome
                                   ↓
                        Identify next physical action
                                   ↓
                           ORGANIZE appropriately
                                   ↓
                            REFLECT regularly
                                   ↓
                              ENGAGE with confidence
```

## GTD and Other Systems

**GTD Combines Well With:**
- **PARA** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) - Folder organization
- **Zettelkasten** - Knowledge management
- **Time blocking** - Execution layer
- **Eisenhower Matrix** - Priority assessment

**GTD Provides:**
- The workflow (how to process inputs)
- The commitment tracking (projects and next actions)
- The context filtering (where to work)

**Other Systems Add:**
- Folder structure (PARA)
- Knowledge building (Zettelkasten)
- Time allocation (time blocking)
- Priority frameworks (Eisenhower, RICE, etc.)

## Key Quotes from David Allen

> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them."

> "You can do anything, but not everything."

> "If it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind."

> "The better you get at processing your 'in-basket,' the more productive you can be with minimal effort."

> "You don't actually do a project; you can only do action steps related to it."

## Common Misconceptions

**Myth:** GTD is just a fancy to-do list
**Reality:** GTD is a complete workflow system for managing all inputs in your life

**Myth:** GTD requires expensive tools or apps
**Reality:** GTD works with paper and pen. Tools are personal preference

**Myth:** GTD is about doing more
**Reality:** GTD is about having a clear mind so you can engage fully with what you choose to do

**Myth:** You need to follow GTD perfectly
**Reality:** Use what works, adapt what doesn't. The principles matter more than perfect execution

**Myth:** GTD takes too much time to maintain
**Reality:** Once established, processing and review take less time than mental stress and forgotten commitments

## Implementation in This System

**Our commands map to GTD stages:**

| GTD Stage | Our Command | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Capture** | `/capture` | Get it out of your head |
| **Clarify** | `/process-inbox` | Apply clarifying questions |
| **Organize** | `/process-inbox` | Route to appropriate locations |
| **Reflect** | `/process-inbox` (3x/week) + `/daily-closeout` | Review and update |
| **Engage** | `/daily-plan` | Choose what to work on based on context/energy/time/priority |

**Key Integration:**
- `/process-inbox` combines Clarify + Organize + Reflect (weekly review concepts)
- `/daily-plan` implements Engage (four criteria model)
- `/daily-closeout` adds Reflect (daily review)

**Why We Combined Stages:**
- Simplicity - Fewer commands to remember
- Efficiency - Process and review happen together
- Sustainability - More likely to do it regularly if it's integrated

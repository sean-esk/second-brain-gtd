## 🚨 CRITICAL: Vault Folder Configuration

**ALL Second Brain operations MUST work in the vault folder.**

**Vault folder is stored in:** `.claude/vault-config.json`

**To find the vault folder:**
1. Read `.claude/vault-config.json`
2. Look for `vaultFolder` property
3. Use that folder name for ALL file operations

**Example:**
```json
{
  "vaultFolder": "General",
  "setupDate": "2025-10-25",
  "setupComplete": true,
  "userName": "Sean"
}
```

**This means:**
- If vaultFolder = "General", use `General/00-Inbox/Daily/` (not `ObsidianVault/00-Inbox/Daily/`)
- If vaultFolder = "MyVault", use `MyVault/00-Inbox/Daily/`
- etc.

**NEVER hardcode "ObsidianVault/" paths in your responses.**

**How to use:**
1. At start of ANY Second Brain command, read `.claude/vault-config.json`
2. Extract `vaultFolder` value
3. Use that in all paths: `{{vaultFolder}}/00-Inbox/Daily/`

**If vault-config.json doesn't exist:**
- User hasn't run `/setup` yet
- Prompt them: "Please run `/setup` first to configure your Second Brain"
- Do not proceed

**This is configured during `/setup` command (Step 0) and ensures all files are saved in the correct location.**

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian vault template for creating a Personal Second Brain - a knowledge management and productivity system combining:

- **GTD (Getting Things Done)** - Task and project management
- **Zettelkasten** - Atomic note-taking for knowledge building
- **PARA Method** - Folder organization (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- **Claude Integration** - AI-powered commands and automation

**This is a generic starter template.** Users customize it during `/setup` to match their specific needs, goals, and workflows.

## Key Principles

### ADHD-Friendly Editing

**The system is designed for users who may have ADHD. When editing documents:**

1. **Read the entire document first** - Understand existing structure and content
2. **Make targeted edits** - Update specific sections, don't append new ones
3. **Never just add to the bottom** - Unless explicitly asked to append
4. **Keep it concise** - Remove redundancy, don't create multiple versions of the same section
5. **One plan, not many** - When updating plans, replace the old plan, don't add "revised plan" sections

**Bad example:** Adding "REVISED PLAN" section below "TODAY'S PLAN" section
**Good example:** Replacing "TODAY'S PLAN" content with updated tasks checked off

This is critical for managing ADHD. Bloated documents with multiple versions of the same information are counterproductive and overwhelming.

---

## Folder Structure

### PARA + Zettelkasten Hybrid

**PARA** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) provides folder organization based on actionability.
**Zettelkasten** governs note-taking (atomic notes, bidirectional linking, progressive elaboration).

```
ObsidianVault/                    # Vault root
├── 00-Inbox/                    # Unprocessed captures
│   ├── Daily/                   # ALL captures from /capture
│   └── Fleeting-Notes/          # Knowledge items from /process-inbox
├── 01-Projects/                 # Active projects (GTD multi-step outcomes)
├── 02-Areas/                    # Ongoing responsibilities (no end date)
│   ├── Career-Development.md
│   ├── Health-Fitness.md
│   ├── Personal-Development.md
│   ├── Errands.md
│   ├── Personal-Todos.md
│   └── Relationships/           # Individual notes per person
├── 03-Resources/                # Reference materials
│   └── Reference-Notes/         # Summaries of external sources
├── 04-Archives/                 # Completed/inactive projects
├── Daily Plans/                 # Generated by /daily-plan and /daily-closeout
├── Meeting Notes/               # Meeting documentation (archival)
├── Permanent Notes/             # YOUR insights and ideas (Zettelkasten)
└── Templates/                   # Reusable templates
```

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Permanent Notes** = Your synthesized insights (Zettelkasten method)
- **Reference Notes** = Summaries of others' work
- **Projects** = Multi-step outcomes (can be small or large)
- **Areas** = Ongoing responsibilities (Career, Health, Personal, Errands, etc.)
- **Relationships** = Individual notes for important people (business partners, family, key colleagues)

**Unified Task Structure:** All projects, areas, and relationship notes use the same priority sections (High Priority, Next Actions, Someday/Maybe, Waiting On) so `/daily-plan` can scan consistently.

**User Customization:** During `/setup`, users define their specific project areas and ongoing responsibilities. The structure adapts to their needs.

- Sets up folder structure
- Provides onboarding guidance

#### `/capture`
**Purpose:** Get it out of your head and into the system (GTD Capture stage)
**When:** Anytime you have a thought, task, or idea
**What it does:**
- Appends ALL captures to `ObsidianVault/00-Inbox/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- No categorization, no routing - just capture with timestamp
- Works for single items OR full brain dumps
- **GTD Principle:** "Capture first, clarify later"

#### `/process-inbox`
**Purpose:** Clarify, organize, and review (GTD Clarify + Organize + Reflect stages)
**When:** 3x per week minimum
**What it does:**
- Asks clarifying questions FIRST for vague items
- Applies GTD clarifying questions to each capture
- Routes to appropriate locations:
  - Actionable → Projects/Tasks
  - Knowledge → Fleeting notes (for later development)
  - Reference → Reference notes
- Reviews all active projects (mini weekly review)
- Archives completed projects
- Updates _Context.md

#### `/daily-plan`
**Purpose:** Choose what to work on today (GTD Engage stage)
**When:** Every morning
**What it does:**
- Checks inbox first (prompts to run `/process-inbox` if 5+ items)
- Handles "no projects" scenario (guides user to create projects)
- Reads all active projects and extracts next actions
- Asks about energy, context, time available (GTD four criteria)
- Generates prioritized task list (must-do, should-do, quick-wins)
- Creates/enhances plan in `ObsidianVault/Daily Plans/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If draft plan exists from closeout, enhances it with energy/context
- Updates `_Context.md`

#### `/daily-closeout`
**Purpose:** Daily reflection and tomorrow prep (GTD Reflect stage)
**When:** Every evening
**What it does:**
- Reads today's plan from `Daily Plans/`
- Asks what was accomplished
- Marks completed/partial/deferred items
- Asks about tomorrow's priorities (optional)
- Creates tomorrow's DRAFT plan (priorities without energy/context)
- Clarifies this is a draft - will be refined by `/daily-plan` in morning
- Updates `_Context.md`

## System Design

### Integrated GTD + Zettelkasten

**Commands:**
- `/setup` - Initial configuration
- `/capture` - Capture everything
- `/process-inbox` - Organize and clarify using GTD
- `/daily-plan` - Plan execution
- `/daily-closeout` - Review and prepare

**Note types:**
- Projects, Tasks, Areas (GTD - for execution)
- Permanent notes, Reference notes (Zettelkasten - for knowledge)

**Key principle:** `/process-inbox` uses both GTD and Zettelkasten principles to route items appropriately:
- Actionable items → Projects/Tasks (GTD)
- Knowledge/insights → Permanent/Reference notes (Zettelkasten)
- Everything gets organized, nothing falls through cracks

4. **Every evening:** `/daily-closeout` → Reflect + Prep tomorrow (GTD Reflect) (5 min)

**Total time commitment:** ~20-25 min/day + 45 min/week processing = Sustainable!

**GTD stages covered:**
- Capture → `/capture`
- Clarify + Organize → `/process-inbox`
- Reflect → `/process-inbox` + `/daily-closeout`
- Engage → `/daily-plan`

## Important Notes

### This is a Template

This repository provides a **starting template**. Each user:
- Defines their own goals during `/setup`
- Creates their own project areas
- Customizes tags to their businesses/life domains
- Adapts the system to their workflow

**Do not assume** generic goals, businesses, or priorities. Always reference the user's `Assisting-User-Context.md`.

### User-Specific Customizations

After `/setup`, the system contains:
- User's personal goals and priorities
- User's specific project areas (Work, Side-Business, Personal, etc.)
- User's specific area tags (#work, #health-fitness, etc.)
- User's chosen workflows and rhythms

Commands should **adapt to the user's setup**, not impose generic structures.

---

## Documentation

The system includes two main documentation files:

### README.md
**Purpose:** System overview and usage documentation for developers
**Audience:** Users who already have prerequisites installed
**Contents:**
- Quick project overview
- Streamlined quick start (assumes prerequisites installed)
- Core workflow and commands
- Customization options
- Usage troubleshooting

**When to use:** For understanding what the system does and how to use it after setup is complete.

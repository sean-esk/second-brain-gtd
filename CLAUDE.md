## 🚨 CRITICAL: Vault Path Configuration

**ALL Second Brain operations MUST work in the configured vault path.**

**Configuration is stored in:** `~/.second-brain/config.json` (persistent across sessions)

**To find the vault path:**
1. Read `~/.second-brain/config.json`
2. Look for `vaultPath` property
3. Use that path for ALL file operations

**Example:**
```json
{
  "vaultPath": "/Users/yourname/Documents/MyVault",
  "setupDate": "2025-10-25",
  "setupComplete": true,
  "userName": "Sean",
  "userContext": "Permanent Notes/Assisting-User-Context.md",
  "preferences": {
    "proactiveCapture": true,
    "inboxThreshold": 5
  }
}
```

**This means:**
- All operations use the absolute `vaultPath` from config
- No need to specify the vault location each session
- Works for both Claude Code AND Claude Desktop

**NEVER hardcode vault paths in your responses.**

**How to use:**
1. At start of ANY Second Brain operation, read `~/.second-brain/config.json`
2. Extract `vaultPath` value
3. Use that in all paths: `{{vaultPath}}/00-Inbox/Daily/`

**If config.json doesn't exist:**
- User hasn't run setup yet
- Prompt them: "Let's set up your Second Brain first. What's the path to your Obsidian vault?"
- Do not proceed with other operations

**This is configured during setup and persists forever across all sessions.**

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian vault template for creating a Personal Second Brain - a knowledge management and productivity system combining:

- **GTD (Getting Things Done)** - Task and project management
- **Zettelkasten** - Atomic note-taking for knowledge building
- **PARA Method** - Folder organization (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- **Claude Integration** - AI-powered skill with natural language triggers

**This is a generic starter template.** Users customize it during setup to match their specific needs, goals, and workflows.

## Key Principles

### ADHD-Friendly Editing

**The system is designed for users who may have ADHD. When editing documents:**

1. **Read the entire document first** - Understand existing structure and content
2. **Make targeted edits** - Update specific sections, don't append new ones
3. **Never just add to the bottom** - Unless explicitly asked to append
4. **Keep it concise** - Remove redundancy, don't create multiple versions of the same section
5. **One plan, not many** - When updating plans, replace the old plan, don't add "revised plan" sections

**Bad example:** Adding "REVISED PLAN" section below "TODAY'S PLAN" section
**Good example:** Replacing "TODAY'S PLAN" content with updated tasks checked off

This is critical for managing ADHD. Bloated documents with multiple versions of the same information are counterproductive and overwhelming.

---

## Folder Structure

### PARA + Zettelkasten Hybrid

**PARA** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) provides folder organization based on actionability.
**Zettelkasten** governs note-taking (atomic notes, bidirectional linking, progressive elaboration).

```
ObsidianVault/                    # Vault root
├── 00-Inbox/                    # Unprocessed captures
│   ├── Daily/                   # ALL captures from /capture
│   └── Fleeting-Notes/          # Knowledge items from /process-inbox
├── 01-Projects/                 # Active projects (GTD multi-step outcomes)
├── 02-Areas/                    # Ongoing responsibilities (no end date)
│   ├── Career-Development.md
│   ├── Health-Fitness.md
│   ├── Personal-Development.md
│   ├── Errands.md
│   ├── Personal-Todos.md
│   └── Relationships/           # Individual notes per person
├── 03-Resources/                # Reference materials
│   └── Reference-Notes/         # Summaries of external sources
├── 04-Archives/                 # Completed/inactive projects
├── Daily Plans/                 # Generated by /daily-plan and /daily-closeout
├── Meeting Notes/               # Meeting documentation (archival)
├── Permanent Notes/             # YOUR insights and ideas (Zettelkasten)
└── Templates/                   # Reusable templates
```

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Permanent Notes** = Your synthesized insights (Zettelkasten method)
- **Reference Notes** = Summaries of others' work
- **Projects** = Multi-step outcomes (can be small or large)
- **Areas** = Ongoing responsibilities (Career, Health, Personal, Errands, etc.)
- **Relationships** = Individual notes for important people (business partners, family, key colleagues)

**Unified Task Structure:** All projects, areas, and relationship notes use the same priority sections (High Priority, Next Actions, Someday/Maybe, Waiting On) so `/daily-plan` can scan consistently.

**User Customization:** During `/setup`, users define their specific project areas and ongoing responsibilities. The structure adapts to their needs.

## Second Brain Skill

The system provides a unified AI-powered skill with natural language triggers. Just talk naturally!

### Natural Language Triggers

#### Setup / Configure
**Trigger phrases:** "set up my second brain", "configure my vault", "second brain setup"
**Purpose:** Interactive onboarding to configure the system
**When:** First-time setup or reconfiguration
**What it does:**
- Asks for vault path (saved permanently to `~/.second-brain/config.json`)
- Asks about user's goals (6-month, 3-month, 1-month)
- Creates `Assisting-User-Context.md` permanent note
- Sets up folder structure (works with existing vaults!)
- Provides onboarding guidance

#### Capture
**Trigger phrases:** "capture this", "save this thought", "remember this", "note this down", "add to my inbox"
**Purpose:** Get it out of your head and into the system (GTD Capture stage)
**When:** Anytime you have a thought, task, or idea
**What it does:**
- Appends ALL captures to `{{vaultPath}}/00-Inbox/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- No categorization, no routing - just capture with timestamp
- Works for single items OR full brain dumps
- **GTD Principle:** "Capture first, clarify later"

#### Process Inbox
**Trigger phrases:** "process my inbox", "organize my captures", "clarify my tasks", "GTD processing"
**Purpose:** Clarify, organize, and review (GTD Clarify + Organize + Reflect stages)
**When:** 3x per week minimum
**What it does:**
- Asks clarifying questions FIRST for vague items
- Applies GTD clarifying questions to each capture
- Routes to appropriate locations:
  - Actionable → Projects/Tasks
  - Knowledge → Fleeting notes (for later development)
  - Reference → Reference notes
- Reviews all active projects (mini weekly review)
- Archives completed projects
- Updates _Context.md

#### Daily Planning
**Trigger phrases:** "plan my day", "what should I work on", "daily planning", "morning planning"
**Purpose:** Choose what to work on today (GTD Engage stage)
**When:** Every morning
**What it does:**
- Checks inbox first (prompts to process if 5+ items)
- Handles "no projects" scenario (guides user to create projects)
- Reads all active projects and extracts next actions
- Asks about energy, context, time available (GTD four criteria)
- Generates prioritized task list (must-do, should-do, quick-wins)
- Creates/enhances plan in `{{vaultPath}}/Daily Plans/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If draft plan exists from closeout, enhances it with energy/context
- Updates `_Context.md`

#### Daily Closeout
**Trigger phrases:** "daily closeout", "review my day", "end of day review", "evening reflection"
**Purpose:** Daily reflection and tomorrow prep (GTD Reflect stage)
**When:** Every evening
**What it does:**
- Reads today's plan from `Daily Plans/`
- Asks what was accomplished
- Marks completed/partial/deferred items
- Asks about tomorrow's priorities (optional)
- Creates tomorrow's DRAFT plan (priorities without energy/context)
- Clarifies this is a draft - will be refined by daily planning in morning
- Updates `_Context.md`

### Proactive Capture

**IMPORTANT:** When researching topics or discussing ideas, Claude will offer to capture valuable insights:

> "That's an interesting insight about [topic]. Would you like me to capture this to your Second Brain?"

This ensures valuable knowledge from conversations isn't lost.

## Working with This Vault

### When Assisting Users

1. **Respect ADHD-friendly editing** - Read entire documents before editing, make targeted updates
2. **Reference user context** - Check `Assisting-User-Context.md` to understand priorities
3. **Use PARA structure** - Place notes in appropriate actionability category
4. **Follow Zettelkasten principles** - Atomic notes, own words, 3+ links
5. **Maintain frontmatter** - Include date, tags, status, type on all notes
6. **Be encouraging** - Positive, helpful tone without judgment
7. **Explain reasoning** - Help users understand why suggestions are made

### Note Creation Guidelines

**Frontmatter (required):**
```yaml
---
title: "Note Title"
created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
status: active/draft/completed
type: project/area/resource/permanent-note/etc
---
```

**File Naming:**
- Projects: Descriptive names (`Website-Redesign.md`)
- Daily Plans: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Permanent Notes: Descriptive concept (`Context-Switching-Reduces-Focus.md`)
- Meeting Notes: `YYYY-MM-DD - Topic.md`
- MOCs: `MOC - Topic.md`

**Linking:**
- Use `[[double brackets]]` for internal links
- Minimum 3+ links for permanent notes (no orphans)
- Explain relationships in link context

**Tags:**
- Use hierarchical tags: `#status/active`, `#context/computer`
- Type tag required: `#project`, `#permanent-note`, etc
- Business/area tags: User-defined during setup
- Status tags: Track workflow state

---

## Quality Standards

### For Permanent Notes (Zettelkasten)

- ✅ **Atomic** - One clear idea, 100-300 words, stands alone
- ✅ **Connected** - 3+ meaningful links with explanation
- ✅ **Clear** - Own words, concrete examples, explains value
- ✅ **Proper structure** - Follows atomic note template
- ✅ **Complete metadata** - All required frontmatter

### For Projects (GTD)

- ✅ **Has next action** - Concrete physical action defined
- ✅ **Has status** - Current workflow state tracked
- ✅ **Has priority** - Relative importance specified
- ✅ **Updated regularly** - < 7 days since last update
- ✅ **Links to resources** - Connected to relevant permanent notes

## System Design

### Integrated GTD + Zettelkasten

**Natural Language Triggers:**
- "Set up my second brain" - Initial configuration
- "Capture: [thought]" - Capture everything
- "Process my inbox" - Organize and clarify using GTD
- "Plan my day" - Plan execution
- "Daily closeout" - Review and prepare

**Note types:**
- Projects, Tasks, Areas (GTD - for execution)
- Permanent notes, Reference notes (Zettelkasten - for knowledge)

**Key principle:** Inbox processing uses both GTD and Zettelkasten principles to route items appropriately:
- Actionable items → Projects/Tasks (GTD)
- Knowledge/insights → Permanent/Reference notes (Zettelkasten)
- Everything gets organized, nothing falls through cracks

## Important Notes

### This is a Template

This repository provides a **starting template**. Each user:
- Defines their own goals during setup ("set up my second brain")
- Creates their own project areas
- Customizes tags to their businesses/life domains
- Adapts the system to their workflow

**Do not assume** generic goals, businesses, or priorities. Always reference the user's `Assisting-User-Context.md`.

### User-Specific Customizations

After setup, the system contains:
- User's personal goals and priorities
- User's specific project areas (Work, Side-Business, Personal, etc.)
- User's specific area tags (#work, #health-fitness, etc.)
- User's chosen workflows and rhythms

Commands should **adapt to the user's setup**, not impose generic structures.

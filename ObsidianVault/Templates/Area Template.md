**Template Guidance for Claude:**
- **Purpose** = What you're maintaining (not completing)
- **High Priority** = Urgent tasks (scan first in daily-plan)
- **Next Actions** = Regular priority (scan second)
- **Someday/Maybe** = Skip in daily planning (keeps focus)
- **Waiting On** = Blocked items
- **Projects** = Link active projects supporting this area
- **Recurring** = Checklists for regular responsibilities
- Areas have no deadline - they're ongoing
- Use same task structure as projects for consistency

> **What to put here:** Quick capture of a thought, idea, or insight that needs further development. This is temporary - process into a permanent note within a few days.

## The Idea

{{Capture the core thought in your own words. Don't worry about perfection - just get it down.}}

{{Add any context that will help you remember this later.}}

## Why It Caught Your Attention

{{What made you want to capture this? Why does it matter?}}

## Potential Connections

{{Any notes, projects, or ideas this might relate to? (You'll develop these when converting to permanent note)}}

**Processing guidance:**
When ready, this should become either:
1. **Permanent Note** - If it's an insight or concept you want to develop (use Permanent Note template)
2. **Reference Note** - If it's just information from a source (use Reference Note template)
3. **Added to Project** - If it's actually an action item
4. **Deleted** - If it's no longer relevant

**How to tell:**
- Ask yourself: "Is this MY insight or someone else's information?"
  - Your insight → Permanent Note
  - Their information → Reference Note
  - Actionable → Add to project

## 🎯 Success Metrics for Week 1

By the end of your first week, you should be able to answer YES to:

- [ ] I know what `/capture` does (get it out of my head)
- [ ] I know what `/process-inbox` does (organize and review)
- [ ] I know what `/daily-plan` does (prioritize my day)
- [ ] I know what `/daily-closeout` does (review and prep tomorrow)
- [ ] I've run `/capture` at least 10 times
- [ ] I've run `/process-inbox` at least 2-3 times
- [ ] I've run `/daily-plan` at least 3-4 times
- [ ] I've run `/daily-closeout` at least 2-3 times
- [ ] My inbox has been at zero at least twice
- [ ] I have 2-5 active projects
- [ ] I understand the capture → process → plan → closeout loop

---

## 💡 The Core Loop (Commit This to Memory)

```
Throughout day: CAPTURE (get it out of your head)
           ↓
3x per week: PROCESS (clarify and organize)
           ↓
Every morning: PLAN (prioritize for today)
           ↓
Every evening: CLOSEOUT (review and prep tomorrow)
           ↓
        (repeat)
```

**This is the entire system!** Master this loop and everything else follows.

## 🚨 Common First Week Mistakes

### Mistake: Not Capturing Enough
**Problem:** Trying to organize in your head instead of using the system
**Solution:** Capture EVERYTHING, even tiny thoughts. Trust the system.

### Mistake: Trying to Organize While Capturing
**Problem:** Spending time categorizing during `/capture`
**Solution:** Just get it down! `/process-inbox` will organize it later.

### Mistake: Skipping Processing
**Problem:** Inbox fills up, you lose trust in the system
**Solution:** Process 3x this week (even if inbox is small)

### Mistake: Perfectionism
**Problem:** Trying to make perfect notes or perfect projects
**Solution:** Done is better than perfect. Refine over time.

### Mistake: Not Running Daily Closeout
**Problem:** Miss reflection and tomorrow prep
**Solution:** Make it a 5-minute ritual. Non-negotiable.

## 🎓 What You're Learning

**Week 1 Focus:**
- Muscle memory for the 5 commands
- Trust that the system works
- Separation of capture vs clarify vs organize
- Daily rhythm (plan, capture, closeout)
- Weekly processing habit

**Don't worry about:**
- Perfect note structure (that comes later)
- Linking everything together (build over time)
- Advanced features (focus on basics first)
- Making it "perfect" (it evolves with use)

---

## 📈 After Week 1

Once you've completed this checklist and feel comfortable with the core loop:

**Week 2-4:**
- Refine your project structures
- Start creating permanent notes from fleeting notes
- Build more sophisticated project plans
- Customize templates to your preferences

**Month 2+:**
- System becomes second nature
- Build knowledge network with permanent notes
- Link projects to knowledge
- Customize workflows

---

## ❓ Need Help?

**Stuck on a command?** Each command has built-in guidance.

**Forgot the workflow?** See this guide or `README.md` in parent folder.

**System not working?** Usually means:
- Not capturing enough (capture more!)
- Not processing regularly (do it 3x/week!)
- Not running daily rhythm (make it habitual!)

---

## 🎯 Your Goal This Week

**By Friday:**
- [ ] Complete this entire checklist
- [ ] Feel comfortable with the 5 commands
- [ ] Have processed inbox to zero at least twice
- [ ] Have at least one completed task
- [ ] Trust the system enough to stop keeping mental lists

**You've got this!**

The system gets better every day you use it. Stay consistent this week and it will become natural.

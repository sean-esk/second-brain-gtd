# Relationships

This folder contains individual notes for important people in your life.

---

## Purpose

Track conversations, commitments, and tasks related to specific people.

**Use relationship notes for:**
- Business partners and co-founders
- Key colleagues and team members
- Family members you interact with regularly
- Mentors, advisors, or coaches
- Clients (if applicable)
- Friends you collaborate with

---

## How It Works

**Create one note per person using the Relationship Note template.**

**What to track:**
- Things you want to discuss with them
- Tasks or commitments related to them
- What you're waiting on from them
- Important conversations and decisions
- Background context and preferences

**Example notes:**
- `John-Smith.md` - Business partner
- `Mom.md` - Family
- `Sarah-Johnson.md` - Key colleague
- `Alex-Chen.md` - Mentor

---

## Task Integration

Relationship notes use the same task structure as projects and areas:
- **High Priority** - Urgent things to discuss or do
- **Next Actions** - Things to bring up when you talk
- **Waiting On** - Items you're waiting on from them
- **Someday/Maybe** - Future discussion topics

**This means `/daily-plan` will scan relationship notes too!**

If you need to "discuss Q2 budget with John" and it's high priority, it will show up in your daily plan.

## Processing Captures

When you `/capture` something about a person:
- "Need to ask Sarah about the proposal"
- "Discuss new strategy with John"
- "Check in with Mom about Thanksgiving"

**During `/process-inbox`:**
- If the person has a relationship note → adds to their note
- If they don't but are important → creates new relationship note
- If it's a one-off → adds as regular task to appropriate area

## Not Sure Who Needs a Relationship Note?

**Good candidates:**
- You interact with them regularly (weekly/monthly)
- You have ongoing commitments or projects with them
- You need to track multiple conversations over time
- They're important to your work or personal life

**Don't need relationship notes for:**
- One-time contacts
- Service providers (dentist, mechanic, etc.) - these are just tasks in areas
- Large groups (create a Project instead)

---

**When in doubt, just capture it and `/process-inbox` will help you decide!**
